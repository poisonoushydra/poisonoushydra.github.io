My name is Alexander and I am a technomancer who lives in Canada. I am very passionate about music, film, literature and the arts. I enjoy discovering and exploring new technologies. I am currently actively interested in Type-1 Hypervisors and am exploring the possibility of obtaining a degree in cybersecurity.
