It helps immensely with both my physical and mental health. I wanted to start journalling my progress as much as possible since my Pebble and Apple Health are not as reliable as I would like in maintaining this data over an extended period of time. 

My current personal best is: 

**33.5 kilometres on January 18th 2021**

*Rows with data in the Kilometres column were taken from Pebble Health.* 

*Rows with blank Kilometres column were taken from Apple Health or Gadgetbridge except where there were obvious discrepancies between the two indicating that my Pebble was either not worn for that particular excursion or did not sync data to the app correctly.*
