# Walking...

I recently discovered walking as an excellent hobby and a great way to stay in shape. It helps immensely with both my physical and mental health. I typically walk between 10-30 kilometres in a single day. I wanted to start tracking my progress as much as possible since my Pebble and Apple Health are not as reliable as I would like in maintaining this data over an extended period of time. 

My current personal best is: 

**33.5 kilometres on January 18th 2021**
